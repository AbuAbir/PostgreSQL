# Overview of PostgreSQL

This is an overview and documentation of PostgreSQL database management system.

## What is a database?

A database is a collection of data. Information are stored in database in forms of tables. We want our tables to be redundant. One table might have some kind of relationship with other tables. The type of database system where relations of tables are maintained, are known as relational database system. PostgreSQL is an object-relational database system (not database).

## Database Management System and PostgreSQL

A Database Management System (DBMS) is a system that manages databases where databases can be-
* stored
* manipulated or
* retrieved

PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is an open source object-relational DBMS and has more than 30 years of active development on its core platform. SQL is the language for designing the data manipulation and management. Postgres is popular for its robustness, extensiveness, security, proven-architecture and the dedication of its open-source community developers. It runs on all major operating systems.

## Windows Installation:

(Updating later)

## Connecting to DB Server
If database_name is an already created database then the following command is used to connect to the database.
```
\c database_name
```

## Storing, manipulating and retrieving database:
We are going to use an art store database already designed in [here](https://github.com/Radhima/Art-Store-Database) as a demo. The database in that link is created on Oracle DBMS. Here, a PostgreSQL version of the same database is used.


### Storing in a database

To create a database, the 

```
CREATE DATABASE;
```
command is passed. (Note to add semi-colon, otherwise the command will not be executed.) 

Then the user should be connected to the database in the way mentioned above.

#### Tables
Databases are made of tables. Each table is an entity. We donâ€™t want all the information in a simple table as they will be hard to retrieve and manipulate. Rather the tables are created in object redundant form.  A table have rows and columns. Here columns are the features of a single entity while row is an entity itself. To create a table feature-names are added. The command for creating table is 

```
    CREATE TABLE TABLE_NAME(
    COL_NAME_1 DATA_TYPE CONSTRAINTS_IF_ANY,
      ...,
      ...,
      ...,
    COL_NAME_N DATA_TYPE CONSTRAINTS_IF_ANY,
    )
    ;
```

Additional Constraints can be added on the table columns. The example of additional constraints are: not null, unique, primary key, foreign key etc.
While inserting data on the table if constraints are not met, then an error message will generate.

The SQL command from [here](https://github.com/Radhima/PostgreSQL/blob/master/tables.sql) was inserted to get the following output:

Then if we want to see the created tables we use the command:
    ```/d```

The resultant output when the above commands are inserted is shown here:
![Tables](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28762555/89862146-27270700-dbc9-11ea-94fa-a779f9fec1d5.png)
    

#### Inserting in a table
To insert in a table the syntax to be used is:

```
INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME(
COLUMN_NAMES_SEPARATED_BY_COMMAS) 
VALUES (
VALUE_OF_COLUMNS_IN_SAME_ORDER)
;
```

Here, we see we may not add all columns to insert values. But not null constraints must be maintained. Again we can write column names in any order but values should be in same order as columns. We are using the demo values in [here](https://github.com/Radhima/PostgreSQL/blob/master/insert.sql) for the insertion. An example for the shipping table is shown below:

![Insert output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28762555/89914576-04bbda80-dc17-11ea-83c9-b19d259a5025.png)

### Retrieving from a database
To retrieve from a database we use ``` SELECT``` command. The command with other conditions can successfully retrieve the required data. These are described below:

#### Retrieving all column records from a single table
The command for this is:
```
SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME;

```

This will output all the data for all columns of all records. For our demo database, the following output is generated:

![select all](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28762555/89909810-4a75a480-dc11-11ea-8311-d7dc98cb63fc.png)


#### Retrieving selected column records from a single table
Only required columns are selected for retrieval. The query is:

```
SELECT COLUMN_NAMES_SEPERATED_BY_COLUMN FROM TABLE_NAME;

```
When run on the same product table with selected columns, the generated output is:

![select some](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28762555/89909814-4c3f6800-dc11-11ea-8be7-58d80e238456.png)


#### Retrieving records based on conditions on column entry

The ```where``` keyword is used for conditions. The conditions can be comparing, range, string matching etc. Examples of these conditions are given below:

* Comparing: ```<>```, ```=```, ```<=```, ```>=```, ```<```, ```>``` are used for comparing values. 

![compare](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28762555/89909828-4fd2ef00-dc11-11ea-85ce-d25e17fbe621.png)

* Range: ```BETWEEN``` keyword is used for range comparison

![between](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28762555/89909821-4ea1c200-dc11-11ea-89ad-e2afc406255b.png)

* String Matching: ```LIKE``` and ```ILIKE``` keywords are used. Here ```ILIKE``` is case insensitive. Examples are:

![like](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28762555/89909790-45185a00-dc11-11ea-8ec1-d2df9db567b5.png)
![ilike](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28762555/89909843-53ff0c80-dc11-11ea-93a9-7f34fc654160.png)

#### Retrieving records with ```IN```
When there are multiple conditions, the query becomes too large and is complex and prone to error. ```IN``` keyword reduces the hassle:
![in](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28762555/89909847-5497a300-dc11-11ea-9545-be69ed9a9d06.png)


#### Retrieving ordered column records

The keyword ```ORDER BY``` is used for sorting the columns as listed in the query. To sort by ascending order ```ASC``` and descending order
```DESC``` keyword is used. The default order is ascending so ```ASC``` can be omitted. 

The query is:

```
SELECT COLUMN_NAMES FROM TABLE_NAME ORDER_BY COLUMN_NAMES ASC;

SELECT COLUMN_NAMES FROM TABLE_NAME ORDER_BY COLUMN_NAMES DESC;

```

The output for art store database is:

![asc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28762555/89909804-49447780-dc11-11ea-9cb7-06bdcf0a6b43.png)

#### Retrieving distinct entries

The ```distinct``` keyword is used for this.

![distinct](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28762555/89909834-52354900-dc11-11ea-9a99-33eb31e00714.png)
